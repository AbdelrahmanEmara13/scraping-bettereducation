# scraping-bettereducation

to scrape data regarding school rankings from all the pages of the below-given website and provide it in the form of an excel file. When you click on a particular school, it gives further information about Course Range (Levels), Co-Education, Denomination, and Students (approximate) so I need complete information in a flat excel file.


There are about 600 records and the below fields are required for all records:

1. School
2. State Overall Score
3. English
4. Maths
5. Total enrolments
6. Trend/Compare
7. Locality
8. Sector
9. Course Range (Levels)
10. Co-Education
11. Denomination 12
12. Students (approximate)
